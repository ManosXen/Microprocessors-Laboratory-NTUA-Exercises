# Microprocessors Laboratory Exercises - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Microprocessors Laboratory Exercises. The code is written for the NtuaBoardG1, a board designed by the NTUA Microprocessor & Digital Systems Laboratory. This board is based on the ATMega328PB microprocessor. The manual for the NtuaBoardG1 is included in this repository.

## Exercises Overview

Each exercise focuses on a different aspect of microprocessor programming:

* **Exercise 1:** Persistent Delays
    Develop an assembly routine for creating persistent delays.

* **Exercise 2:** Interrupts and Debouncing
    Explore interrupts and implement debouncing techniques.

* **Exercise 3:** Timer/Counter and ADC
    Work with the Timer/Counter and Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

* **Exercise 4:** LCD Display Interface
    Create routines to send data and commands to an LCD display.

* **Exercises 5 & 6:** TWI Protocol and I/O Expander
    Implement the TWI protocol and use the PCA9555D expander to control an LCD and a 4x4 keypad.

* **Exercise 7:** One-Wire Protocol
    Use the One-Wire protocol to control the DS18B20 temperature sensor.

* **Exercise 8:** Hospital Project
        Develop a program that integrates knowledge from all previous exercises. The goal is to create a microcontroller-based system that monitors a patient's temperature and pressure, sending this data to a central server via UART for medical staff to review. The system also allows the patient to request assistance through the microcontroller.

## Repository Structure

Each exercise folder contains the following files:

* **Exercise Description (PDF):** A detailed description of the exercise (in Greek).
* **Solution Report (PDF):** A report outlining the solution (in Greek).
* **Source Code:** The .c and .asm files containing the code for the solution.
